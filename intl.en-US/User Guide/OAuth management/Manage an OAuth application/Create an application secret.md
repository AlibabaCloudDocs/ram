# Create an application secret {#task_266316 .task}

This topic describes how to create an application secret for an application. The application can use this secret to obtain an access token to access Alibaba Cloud APIs on behalf of a user.

1.  Log on to the [RAM console](https://ram.console.aliyun.com/).
2.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **OAuth Applications**.
3.  In the **Application Name** column, click the name of the target application.
4.  On the **App Secrets** tab, click **Create Secret**.
5.  In the displayed dialog box, view the application secret and click **OK**. 

    **Note:** You can create up to two application secrets. The application secret is displayed only once when you first create it, therefore we recommend that you save it for subsequent use.
