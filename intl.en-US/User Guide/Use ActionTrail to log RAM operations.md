# Use ActionTrail to log RAM operations {#concept_cbf_khk_xdb .concept}

RAM has been integrated with [ActionTrail console](https://partners-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/actiontrail), with which you can view the operation and maintenance records of all users \(the primary account and RAM users\) on your instances.

ActionTrail logs the following RAM information:

-   Logon of the primary account and RAM users. For more information, see [ConsoleSignin event log examples](../../../../reseller.en-US/User Guide/ActionTrail Event Examples/ConsoleSignin event log examples.md#)[ConsoleSignin event log examples](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/28828.htm).
-   RAM console operations. For more information, see **A RAM user uses the RAM service in the console** in [RAM event log examples](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/28824.htm).
-   RAM/STS API calling records concerning resource creation, change, or deletion. For more information, see **A RAM user uses the RAM service through the SDK** in [RAM event log examples](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/28824.htm).
