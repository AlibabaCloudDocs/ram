# Create a custom policy {#task_glf_vwf_xdb .task}

This topic describes how to create a custom policy. Custom policies provide more precise control than system policies.

Before you create a custom policy, we recommend that you read about the basic structure and grammar of a policy. For more information, see [Policy structure and grammar](intl.en-US/User Guide/Policies/Policy language/Policy structure and grammar.md#).

1.  Log on to the [RAM console](https://ram.console.aliyun.com/).
2.  Choose **Permissions** \> **Policies**.
3.  Click **Create Policy**.
4.  Enter a policy name and description.
5.  Set the configuration mode. 
    -   If you set the configuration mode to **Visualized**, click **Add Statement** and configure the permission effect, actions, and resources as prompted.
    -   If you set the configuration mode to **Script**, edit the policy according to [policy structure and grammar](intl.en-US/User Guide/Policies/Policy language/Policy structure and grammar.md#).
6.  Click **OK**.
