# Delete a custom policy {#task_221535 .task}

This topic describes how to delete a custom policy. You can delete a custom policy when permissions in this policy change or when you no longer need this policy.

-   The policy has only one version, that is, the default version. If multiple versions exist, you must delete all of the versions except the default one.
-   The policy is not referenced \(that is, attached to a RAM user, RAM user group, or RAM role\). If the policy is currently being referenced, remove related permissions in the policy. For more information, see [Manage policy references](reseller.en-US/User Guide/Policies/Manage policy references.md#).

1.   Log on to the [RAM console](https://partners-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/ram). 
2.   Choose **Permissions** \> **Policies**. 
3.   From the **Policy Type** drop-down list, select **Custom Policy**. 
4.   In the **Policy Name** column, find the target custom policy and click **Delete**. 
5.   Click **OK**.
