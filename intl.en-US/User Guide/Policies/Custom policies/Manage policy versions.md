# Manage policy versions {#task_221550 .task}

This topic describes how to manage policy versions, such as viewing a policy version, setting the default policy version, and deleting a policy version.

-   You can retain multiple versions for a policy.
-   If you reach the maximum number of policy versions allowed, we recommend that you delete versions you no longer need to save space.
-   Even if a policy has multiple versions, only one version is active. The active version is known as the default version.
-   The default version can be viewed but cannot be deleted.

1.  Log on to the [RAM console](https://partners-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/ram).
2.  Choose **Permissions** \> **Policies**.
3.  In the **Policy Name** column, click the name of the target policy.
4.  On the **Versions** tab, you can: 
    -   Click **View** to view the policy version and the policy document.
    -   Click **Use This Version** to set the policy version to the default version.
    -   Click **Delete** to delete the policy version.
