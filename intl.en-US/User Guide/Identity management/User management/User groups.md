# User groups {#concept_hb3_nsf_xdb .concept}

If you have created multiple RAM users under your account, you can create user groups to classify and organize these RAM users for easier user and permission management.

Adding RAM users to user groups means that:

-   When the responsibilities of a user change, you only need to move this user to a group that has the appropriate permissions. Other RAM users are not affected.
-   When the responsibilities of a user group change, you only need to modify the policy attached to the group, and all changes to the policy apply to all RAM users in the group.
