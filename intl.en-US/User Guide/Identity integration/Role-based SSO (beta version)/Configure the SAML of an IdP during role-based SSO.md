# Configure the SAML of an IdP during role-based SSO {#concept_o3t_54r_bhb .concept}

This topic describes how to configure the SAML of an identity provider \(IdP\) during role-based SSO. You can configure Alibaba Cloud as a trusted SAML service provider \(SP\), and configure SAML assertions in the IdP.

## Configure Alibaba Cloud as a trusted SAML SP {#section_ehv_hrj_sfb .section}

1.  Obtain the SAML SP metadata URL from Alibaba Cloud:

    -   Log on to the [SAML SP Metadata URL](https://signin.alibabacloud.com/saml-role/sp-metadata.xml).
    -   Download the XML file and upload it to your IdP.

        **Note:** If the XML file cannot be uploaded to the IdP, you need to manually configure the following parameters:

        -   Entity ID: `urn:alibaba:cloudcomputing:international`
        -   ACS URL: `https://signin.alibabacloud.com/saml-role/sso`
    **Note:** You can also log on to the **RAM console** and choose **SSO** in the left-side navigation pane. On the **Role-based SSO** tab, copy the URL and configure it in your IdP.

2.  Create an SAML SP in the target IdP and configure the SAML SP metadata URL of Alibaba Cloud.

## Configure SAML assertions in the IdP {#section_wyp_hrj_sfb .section}

Alibaba Cloud resolves an SAML assertion to determine a RAM role. Therefore, the SAML assertion generated by the IdP must contain the necessary information of the RAM role.

For more information about the SAML assertion, see [支持角色联合登录的 SAML 断言](EN-US_TP_136748.dita).
