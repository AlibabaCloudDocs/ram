2.   Move the pointer over the account icon and click **Security Settings**. 
3.   In the **Account Protection** section, click **Edit**. 

    **Note:** Virtual MFA is now renamed TOTP.

5.   Click **Submit**. 
6.   Open Google Authenticator. 
7.   On the Identity Verification page, enter the 6-digit verification code obtained from Google Authentication and click **Submit**.
