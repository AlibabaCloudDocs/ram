# Disable an MFA device for a RAM user {#task_221539 .task}

This topic describes how to disable the multi-factor authentication \(MFA\) device for a RAM user under your Alibaba Cloud account.

1.  Log on to the [RAM console](https://partners-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/ram) by using your Alibaba Cloud account. 

    **Note:** If you allow a RAM user under your Alibaba Cloud account to manage its own MFA device, the user can also disable an MFA device in the RAM console. The procedure is as follows: Click **Security**. In the left-side navigation pane, click **MFA Device Management**. Then, click **Disable MFA Device**.

2.  Choose **Identities** \> **Users**.
3.  In the **User Logon Name/Display Name** column, click the username of the target RAM user.
4.  In the **MFA Device** section, click **Disable the virtual MFA device**.
5.  Click **OK**.
