# Create a domain alias for an Alibaba Cloud account {#task_221525 .task}

This topic describes how to create a domain alias for an Alibaba Cloud account. RAM users under your Alibaba Cloud account can use your domain alias that can be resolved on the Internet to log on to the RAM console.

1.  Log on to the [RAM console](https://partners-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/ram).
2.  Choose **Identities** \> **Settings**.
3.  Click the **Advanced** tab.
4.  In the **Domain Alias** section, click **Create Domain Alias**.
5.  In the **Domain Name** field, enter a domain alias.
6.  Click **OK**.
7.  Click **Domain Ownership Verification**. 

    **Note:** After a domain alias is created, copy the verification code and paste the DNS TXT record on the domain purchase platform. After the setting is completed, verify the domain ownership.


You can use a domain alias to simplify the configuration of SAML-based Single Sign On \(SSO\). For more information, see [Configure the SAML for user-based SSO](reseller.en-US/User Guide/SSO management/User-based SSO/Configure the SAML for user-based SSO.md#).
