# RAM user group overview {#concept_662721 .concept}

Alibaba Cloud RAM allows you to create RAM user groups to classify and organize RAM users under your Alibaba Cloud account for easier user and permission management.

-   If the responsibilities of a RAM user change, you only need to move the user to a RAM user group with the appropriate permissions. This action does not affect other RAM users.

    For information about how to create a RAM user group, see [Create a RAM user group](reseller.en-US/User Guide/RAM user groups/Create a RAM user group.md#).

-   If the responsibilities of a RAM user group change, you only need to modify the policy attached to the user group. Changes to the policy apply to all RAM users in the group.

    For information about how to grant permission to a RAM user group, see [Grant permission to a RAM user group](reseller.en-US/User Guide/RAM user groups/Grant permission to a RAM user group.md#).
