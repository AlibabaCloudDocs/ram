# Create a RAM user group {#task_187540 .task}

This topic describes how to create a RAM user group. If you have multiple RAM users under your Alibaba Cloud account, you can create RAM user groups to classify and organize these RAM users for easier user and permission management.

1.   Log on to the [RAM console](https://partners-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/ram). 
2.   Choose **Identities** \> **Groups**. 
3.   Click **Create Group**, and enter the group name, display name, and description. 
4.   Click **OK**. 

You can attach one or more policies to the RAM user group. For more information, see [Grant permission to a RAM user group](reseller.en-US/User Guide/RAM user groups/Grant permission to a RAM user group.md#).
