# Delete a RAM user {#task_187714 .task}

This topic describes how to delete a RAM user. You can delete a RAM user when the user leaves your organization. After a RAM user is deleted, the access key, multi-factor authentication \(MFA\) device, and permissions of the RAM user are also deleted.

1.   Log on to the [RAM console](https://partners-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/ram). 
2.   Choose **Identities** \> **Users**. 
3.   In the **User Logon Name/Display Name** column, select target RAM user and click **Delete**. 
4.   Click **OK**. 

    **Note:** Deleting an active RAM user may result in service failure. Exercise caution when performing this action.
