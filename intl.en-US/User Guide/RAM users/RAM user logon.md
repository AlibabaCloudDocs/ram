-   UPN format: <$username\>@<$AccountAlias\>.onaliyun.com, for example, username@company-alias.onaliyun.com 

    **Note:** The <$username\> is the username of the RAM user, and the <$AccountAlias\>.onaliyun.com is the default domain name.

-   <$username\>@<$AccountAlias\>, for example, username@company-alias 

    **Note:** The <$username\> is the username of the RAM user, and the <$AccountAlias\> is the account alias.
