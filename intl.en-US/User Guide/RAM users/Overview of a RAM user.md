# Overview of a RAM user {#concept_662669 .concept}

A RAM user is a RAM identity with a fixed ID and credential information. Specifically, a RAM user corresponds to an identity, which can be either a person or an application.

-   An Alibaba Cloud account owner can create multiple RAM users \(which correspond to employees, systems, or applications of their enterprise\) under their account.
-   RAM users do not own resources. Rather, the fees incurred by RAM users are billed to the Alibaba Cloud accounts to which they belong. RAM users do not receive individual bills and cannot make payments.
-   RAM users are visible only to the corresponding Alibaba Cloud account to which they belong.
-   RAM users have permissions for only the Alibaba Cloud resources under the Alibaba Cloud account to which they belong after they are authorized to operate on these resources.

**Note:** Enterprises that have multiple Alibaba Cloud resources can use RAM to manage user permissions and resources.
