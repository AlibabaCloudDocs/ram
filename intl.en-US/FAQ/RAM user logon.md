All the RAM user names under the same cloud account are unique, but identical RAM user names under different cloud accounts are allowed. Therefore, you need to specify a cloud account when logging on as a RAM user.

When you log on using the RAM user logon link on the overview page of the RAM console, the system automatically enters an enterprise alias for you.

You can log on to the RAM console using the primary account. ChooseÂ **Settings** \> **Enterprise Alias Settings**, and view and set your cloud account alias.
