# Log on with a RAM user account {#concept_z4m_5hf_xdb .concept}

The RAM user logon endpoint URL is different from the primary account logon endpoint URL. You can find your RAM user logon URL in the dashboard tab of the RAM console.

## Logon entry {#section_ff3_vhf_xdb .section}

The logon entry for RAM users is [https://signin.aliyun.com/login.htm](https://signin.aliyun.com/login.htm). \(You can also query the logon link on the Dashboard page of the [RAM console](https://ram.console.aliyun.com/).\)

## Logon information {#section_gf3_vhf_xdb .section}

RAM user logon requires an enterprise alias, a sub-user name, and a password.

The enterprise alias is the one you have configured in [RAM initial setup](intl.en-US/Quick Start/Ram initial setup.md). If you have not configured the enterprise alias, the default enterprise alias is your cloud account ID \(which can be queried through **Account Management** \> **Security Settings**\).
