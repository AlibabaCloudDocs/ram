This topic describes how to log on to the RAM console as a RAM user, including the address and method to log on to the console.

1.  Log on to the RAM console as a RAM user. 

    **Note:** To view the address that is used by a RAM user to log on to the console, use your Alibaba Cloud account to log on to the [RAM console](https://partners-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/ram). The address is displayed on the Overview page.

2.  Enter the logon name and then click **Next**. 
    -   Method 1: Use the default domain name to log on to the console. The format of the logon name for a RAM user is `<$username>@<$AccountAlias>.onaliyun.com`, for example, username@company-alias.onaliyun.com.

        **Note:** The logon name of a RAM user must be in the User Principal Name \(UPN\) format. All logon names listed in the RAM console use this format. <$username\> represents the username of the RAM user. <$AccountAlias\>.onaliyun.com represents the default domain name.

    -   Method 2: Use the enterprise alias to log on to the console. The format of the logon name for a RAM user is `<$username>@<$AccountAlias>`, for example, username@company-alias.

        **Note:** <$username\> represents the username of the RAM user. <$AccountAlias\> represents the enterprise alias.

    -   Method 3: If you have set a domain alias, you can also use the domain alias to log on to the console. The format of the logon name for a RAM user is `<$username>@<$DomainAlias>`, for example, username@example.com.

        **Note:** <$username\> represents the username of the RAM user. <$DomainAlias\> represents the domain alias.
