# \(Optional\) Set MFA {#concept_u2b_ww2_xdb .concept}

This topic describes how to enable and use Multi-Factor Authentication \(MFA\) to log on to the RAM console.

## Activate MFA for your account {#section_rdj_vtb_rfb .section}

We recommend that you activate MFA for your account so that, when you log on, you are prompted to enter your user name and password \(first factor\) in addition to an authentication code from your specified virtual MFA device \(second factor\). This method greatly increases the overall security of your account.

## Prerequisites {#section_gw3_xw2_xdb .section}

You have installed a virtual MFA application on your smartphone.

We recommend that you install Google Authenticator by using either of the following methods according to your smartphone OS type:

-   For iOS: Install Google Authenticator from the App Store.
-   For Android OS: Install Google Authenticator from Google Play. In addition, you need install a QR scanner from Google Play for Google Authenticator to identify QR codes.

For details about MFA configurations, see the latest information at Google.
