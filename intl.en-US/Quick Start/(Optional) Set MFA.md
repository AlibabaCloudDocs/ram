# \(Optional\) Set MFA {#concept_u2b_ww2_xdb .concept}

This topic describes how to enable and use Multi-Factor Authentication \(MFA\) to log on to the RAM console.

## Activate MFA for your account {#section_rdj_vtb_rfb .section}

We recommend that you activate MFA for your account so that, when you log on, you are prompted to enter your user name and password \(first factor\) in addition to an authentication code from your specified virtual MFA device \(second factor\). This method greatly increases the overall security of your account.

## Prerequisites {#section_gw3_xw2_xdb .section}

You have installed a virtual MFA application on your smartphone.

## Procedure {#section_mlg_jzl_lgb .section}

Depending on the OS of your device, we recommend that you install Google Authenticator as follows:

-   For iOS: Install Google Authenticator from the App Store.
    1.  Open Google Authenticator and click **BEGIN SETUP**.
    2.  Click **Scan barcode** and scan the barcode generated on the MFA page.

        **Note:** After scanning the barcode successfully, you will see your account name and MFA key.

    3.  On the MFA page, enter two consecutive MFA codes and click **Confirm to bind**.
-   For Android: Install Google Authenticator from Google Play.

    **Note:** You need to install a barcode scanner from Google Play for Google Authenticator to identify barcodes.

    1.  Open Google Authenticator and choose **Set up account** from the drop-down menu in the upper-right corner.
    2.  Click **Scan a barcode** and scan the barcode generated on the MFA page.

        **Note:** After scanning the barcode successfully, you will see your account name and MFA key.

    3.  On the MFA page, enter two consecutive MFA codes and click **Confirm to bind**.
