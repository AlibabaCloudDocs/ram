# Introduction {#concept_zf3_q3f_xdb .concept}

This topic describes how to quickly get started with Alibaba Cloud Resource Access Management \(RAM\).

Before you get started with RAM, make sure that:

-   An Alibaba Cloud account is created. If you do not have an Alibaba Cloud account, you can create one on the [Registration](https://account.alibabacloud.com/register/intl_register.htm) page.
-   The RAM service is activated. For more information, see [Activation methods](../../../../reseller.en-US/Pricing/Activation methods.md#).

## Operations in the RAM console {#section_1rn_81o_gm0 .section}

1.  Set a security policy to protect your Alibaba Cloud account. For more information, see [Set a security policy for RAM users](../../../../reseller.en-US/User Guide/Security settings/Basic security settings/Set a security policy for RAM users.md#).
2.  Create a RAM user. For more information, see [Create a RAM user](../../../../reseller.en-US/User Guide/RAM users/Create a RAM user.md#). A RAM user is an entity that you create in Alibaba Cloud to represent the person or application to interact with Alibaba Cloud.
3.  Create a RAM user group to classify and organize RAM users under your Alibaba Cloud account for easier user and permission management. For more information, see [Create a RAM user group](../../../../reseller.en-US/User Guide/RAM user groups/Create a RAM user group.md#).
4.  Grant permission to a RAM user so that the user can access Alibaba Cloud resources. For more information, see [Grant permission to a RAM user](../../../../reseller.en-US/User Guide/RAM users/Grant permission to a RAM user.md#).
5.  Create a custom policy to perform more precise control. For more information, see [Create a custom policy](../../../../reseller.en-US/User Guide/Policies/Custom policies/Create a custom policy.md#).
6.  Log on the RAM console as a RAM user to access Alibaba Cloud resources and perform necessary operations. For more information, see [RAM user logon](../../../../reseller.en-US/User Guide/RAM users/RAM user logon.md#).
