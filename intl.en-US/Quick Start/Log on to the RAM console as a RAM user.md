# Log on to the RAM console as a RAM user {#concept_z4m_5hf_xdb .concept}

The RAM user logon portal is different from the account logon portal. This document describes how to log on to the RAM console as a RAM user.

## Logon portal {#section_ff3_vhf_xdb .section}

After logging on to the [RAM Console](https://partners-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/ram), you can query the logon link on the Overview page.

## Logon information {#section_gf3_vhf_xdb .section}

To log on as a RAM user, you must have the RAM user name and password. RAM user names are in the format of <$username\>@<$AccountAlias\> or <$username\>@<$AccountAlias\>.onaliyun.com.

For details about how to set an account alias, see [Set up initial RAM configurations](reseller.en-US/Quick Start/Set up initial RAM configurations.md#). If no account alias is set, the default account alias is your account ID \(you can find the account ID by going to **Identities** \> **Settings** \> **Advanced** \> **Domain Management** \> **Default Domain**\).
