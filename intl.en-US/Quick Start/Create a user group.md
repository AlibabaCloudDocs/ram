# Create a user group

This topic describes how to create a Resource Access Management \(RAM\) user group. If you have multiple RAM users that belong to your Alibaba Cloud account, you can create RAM user groups to classify and authorize the RAM users by group. This simplifies the management of RAM users and permissions.

1.  Log on to the [RAM console](https://ram.console.aliyun.com/) by using your Alibaba Cloud account.

2.  In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Identities** \> **Groups**.

3.  On the Groups page, click **Create Group**.

4.  In the Create Group panel, configure the **Group Name**, **Display Name**, and **Note** parameters.

5.  Click **OK**.


You can attach one or more policies to the RAM user group. For more information, see [Grant permissions to a RAM user group](/intl.en-US/RAM User Group Management/Grant permissions to a RAM user group.md).
