# Set up MFA \(optional\) {#concept_u2b_ww2_xdb .concept}

This document describes how to activate and use multi-factor authentication \(MFA\) to log on to the RAM console. With MFA, your account security will be improved.

## Activate MFA for your primary account {#section_rdj_vtb_rfb .section}

Your primary account has full control over the resources under it. Once the logon password or access key of the primary account is disclosed, the assets under the account will face great security threats. To reduce the security threats, we strongly recommend that you bind MFA to your primary account.

## Prerequisites {#section_gw3_xw2_xdb .section}

Make sure you have installed on your smartphone a virtual MFA application.

You can install the following virtual MFA applications:

-   iOS: Install Google Authenticator in App Store. The installation method can be found in [iOS-based Google Authenticator installation and use guide](../../../../reseller.en-US/User Guide/Google Authenticator installation and user guide/iOS-based Google Authenticator installation and use guide.md#).
-   Android: Install Google Authenticator in Google Play. The installation method can be found in [Android-based Google Authenticator installation and use guide](../../../../reseller.en-US/User Guide/Google Authenticator installation and user guide/Android-based Google Authenticator installation and use guide.md#).

For details about MFA configurations, see the guidance provided by Google.
