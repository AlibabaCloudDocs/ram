# Create an IdP

This topic describes how to create an identity provider \(IdP\). You must create an IdP before you implement role-based single sign-on \(SSO\).

1.  Log on to the [RAM console](https://ram.console.aliyun.com/) by using your Alibaba Cloud account.

2.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **SSO**.

3.  On the **Role-based SSO** tab of the page that appears, click **Create IdP**.

4.  In the panel that appears, specify **IdP Name** and **Note**.

5.  Click **Upload** under **Metadata File** to upload the SAML metadata file.

    **Note:** The SAML metadata file is provided by your IdP. The file is typically in the XML format and contains the logon URLs, public key used to verify SAML assertions, and assertion format.

6.  Click **OK**.
