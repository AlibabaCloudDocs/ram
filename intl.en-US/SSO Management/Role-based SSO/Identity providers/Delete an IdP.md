# Delete an IdP

If you no longer need an identity provider \(IdP\), you can delete the IdP. This topic describes how to delete an IdP. After you delete an IdP, role-based single sign-on \(SSO\) cannot be implemented between your business system and Resource Access Management \(RAM\).

1.  Log on to the [RAM console](https://ram.console.aliyun.com/) by using your Alibaba Cloud account.

2.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **SSO**.

3.  On the **Role-based SSO** tab, find the specific IdP and click **Delete** in the **Actions** column.

4.  In the Delete IdP message, click **OK**.
