# Modify the basic information about an identity provider

This topic describes how to modify the basic information about an identity provider \(IdP\), such as the IdP description and metadata file.

1.  Log on to the [RAM console](https://ram.console.aliyun.com/) by using your Alibaba Cloud account.

2.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **SSO**.

3.  On the **Role-based SSO** tab, find the specific IdP and click its name.

4.  In the IdP Information section, click **Modify**.

5.  In the Modify IdP Information panel, modify the IdP description or metadata file.

    **Note:** The IdP name cannot be changed. If you change the IdP name, the name is no longer the same as the IdP name that is specified for the trusted entity. This results in SSO failures.

6.  Click **OK**.
