# Delete a custom policy

This topic describes how to delete a custom policy. If permissions in a policy change or you no longer need the policy, you can delete the policy.

The policy is not attached to a RAM user, a RAM user group, or a RAM role. If the policy is attached to a RAM user, a RAM user group, or a RAM role, you must detach the policy before you can delete the policy. For more information, see [Manage policy references](/intl.en-US/Policy Management/Manage policy references.md).

1.  Log on to the [RAM console](https://ram.console.aliyun.com/) by using your Alibaba Cloud account.

2.  In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Permissions** \> **Policies**.

3.  On the Policies page, find the policy that you want to delete and click **Delete** in the **Actions** column.

4.  In the message that appears, click **OK**.
