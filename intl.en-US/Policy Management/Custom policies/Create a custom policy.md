# Create a custom policy

This topic describes how to create a custom policy. Custom policies provide finer-grained access control than system policies.

You have a basic knowledge of the policy elements, structure, and syntax. For more information, see [Policy structure and syntax](/intl.en-US/Policy Management/Policy language/Policy structure and syntax.md).

1.  Log on to the [RAM console](https://ram.console.aliyun.com/) with an Alibaba Cloud account.

2.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Policies** under **Permissions**.

3.  On the Policies page, click **Create Policy**.

4.  On the page that appears, set the **Policy Name** and **Note** parameters.

5.  In the **Configuration Mode** section, select **Visualized** or **Script**.

    -   If you select **Visualized**, click **Add Statement**. In the dialog box that appears, specify the permission effect, actions, and resources, and then click **OK**.
    -   If you select **Script**, edit the policy in the Policy Document section. For more information, see [Policy structure and syntax](/intl.en-US/Policy Management/Policy language/Policy structure and syntax.md).
6.  Click **OK**.
