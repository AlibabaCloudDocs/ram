# Delete an AccessKey pair

This topic describes how to delete an AccessKey pair for a Resource Access Management \(RAM\) user. If a RAM user no longer needs to access Alibaba Cloud resources by calling API operations or using other development tools, you can delete AccessKey pairs for the RAM user.

Before you delete an AccessKey pair, you can query the time when the AccessKey pair was last used to determine whether the AccessKey pair is in use. For information about how to query the time when an AccessKey pair was last used, see [View the information about an AccessKey pair](/intl.en-US/Security Settings/AccessKey pairs/View the information about an AccessKey pair.md).

**Note:** If you delete an AccessKey pair that is being used, system errors may occur. Proceed with caution.

1.  Log on to the [RAM console](https://ram.console.aliyun.com/) by using your Alibaba Cloud account.

2.  In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Identities** \> **Users**.

3.  On the Users page, find the specific RAM user and click its name.

4.  In the **User AccessKeys** section, click **Delete** in the **Actions** column.

5.  Click **OK**.
