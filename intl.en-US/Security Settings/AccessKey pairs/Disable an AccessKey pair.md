# Disable an AccessKey pair

This topic describes how to disable an AccessKey pair of a Resource Access Management \(RAM\) user. If the permissions required by a RAM user change or if the RAM user no longer needs to access Alibaba Cloud resources by calling API operations, you can disable AccessKey pairs of the RAM user.

1.  Log on to the [RAM console](https://ram.console.aliyun.com/) by using your Alibaba Cloud account.

2.  In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Identities** \> **Users**.

3.  On the Users page, find the specific RAM user and click its name.

4.  In the **User AccessKeys** section of the page that appears, find the specific AccessKey pair and click **Disable** in the **Actions** column.

    **Note:** To re-enable the AccessKey pair, click **Enable** in the **Actions** column.

5.  Click **OK**.
