# Change the password for a RAM user

This topic describes how to change the password for a RAM user of your Alibaba Cloud account.

1.  Log on to the [RAM console](https://ram.console.aliyun.com/) with an Alibaba Cloud account.

2.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Users** under **Identities**.

3.  In the **User Logon Name/Display Name** column, click the username of the RAM user.

4.  On the **Authentication** tab, click **Modify Logon Settings**.

5.  In the **Set Logon Password** section of the pane that appears, use one of the following methods to reset the logon password:

    -   Select the **Automatically Regenerate Default Password** option and click **OK**. RAM then automatically generates a logon password. Save the generated new password for subsequent use.
    -   Select the **Reset Custom Password** option, enter a new password, and then click **OK**.
6.  Click **Close**.

    **Note:** If your Alibaba Cloud account allows RAM users to manage their own passwords, the RAM users can also change their passwords in the RAM console.
