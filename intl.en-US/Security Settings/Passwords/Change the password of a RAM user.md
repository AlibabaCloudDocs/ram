# Change the password of a RAM user

This topic describes how to change the password of a RAM user within your Alibaba Cloud account.

1.  Log on to the [RAM console](https://ram.console.aliyun.com/) by using your Alibaba Cloud account.

2.  In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Identities** \> **Users**.

3.  In the **User Logon Name/Display Name** column, click the name of the RAM user.

4.  On the **Authentication** tab of the user details page, click **Modify Logon Settings**.

5.  In the **Set Logon Password** section of the panel that appears, reset the logon password.

    -   If you select **Keep Current Password Unchanged**, the password is not changed.
    -   If you select **Automatically Regenerate Default Password** and click **OK**, the system automatically generates a logon password. You must save the generated password for subsequent use.
    -   If you select **Reset Custom Password**, enter a new password and click **OK**.
6.  Click **Close**.

    **Note:** If your Alibaba Cloud account allows RAM users to manage their passwords, the RAM users can also change their passwords in the console.
